Year One
I dreamt about you again last night. We were in an unfamiliar house, it was barely dawn. You got out of bed and walked out the window, you walked across the lawn but you didn’t touch the wet grass, you were walking on air. I stood at the window watching as you walked higher and higher into the sky and finally the sun was too bright and I couldn’t see you any more.

The ginkgo tree looks like a big toothpick with a few little toothpicks stuck onto it. It stands there in the frozen garden looking lonely and patient. Or maybe that’s me. How is your tree? It’s funny to think that they are clones, they just look like two trees. 

I feel stupid talking to myself like this, but I have to talk to someone and you are so far away.

Year Two
Everything that happens to me, I want to tell you about it. But by the time you are home again, I’ll have forgotten all these small events that make up my days. 

Spring is here, there are daffodils in the garden. The ginkgo tree might be thinking about spring. I can’t tell. It’s strange to imagine you out there moving so fast through space so empty there are no seasons. Is it like a prison cell, your tiny space ship? Or has it become an extension of your own body?

I stand in the garden looking at the night sky, wondering where you are in it.

Year Three
I’m getting used to being alone. I have my own routines, different from our routines. I cancelled the newspaper and instead I read the horoscopes on the internet over breakfast. I got my hair cut differently, just for the heck of it. I have two kittens named Lily and Tilly. They look just alike, black and white spots. They both want to sit on my lap at once. They fight over patches of sunlight. Guess who they remind me of?

The ginkgo tree is having a good summer, it has leafed out and it’s noticably taller now.

Year Four 
I met someone. HIs name is Steven.

I had a dream that you were sleeping and your space ship was singing to you. It sang: Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home. I woke up and Steven was singing in the kitchen, he was making coffee and singing that old song so sweetly, in a voice too quiet to reach you, just barely loud enough to reach into my dream and make a lullaby for your dream self.

Year Five
Do you ever think about Einstein? The clueless bastard. He was right about the math but he never imagined that anyone would actually put his thought experiments into action; he didn’t forsee you and me, separated by time and space and science. He was heartbroken about the atomic bomb, but he never imagined or worried about the small heartbreak of twin girls losing years to an experiment because who would be stupid enough to agree to participate in such a thing? You and me, it turns out.

Science is relentless, it always has to prove things, it can’t leave any magic or mystery or doubt unexamined. All I want is to keep a few secrets (except from you).

Year Six
I worry that I’ve changed too much, that you won’t recognize me when you come home. Steven said, There’s a part of you that I can’t reach, it belongs to your twin and I’ll never know you the way she does. And of course he’s right. But as time passes there’s more and more of me that belongs only to him, and neither of you can be my other half, we are more like a Venn diagram, you both overlap with me and we each have secret individual parts.


Year Seven
I am worried about the ginkgo tree. It doesn’t seem to be growing. It hasn’t died, it doesn’t look bad or anything, it just isn’t getting any taller.

Sometimes I think about moving to a bigger flat, this one is too small for me and Steven and all our books and the cats and all the stuff we have accumulated. But the tree is here and I would feel heartless if I abandoned it. 

Year Eight
Now I am in the extra years, I am moving ahead of you in time. We began together, a single cell that divided and went on dividing until it split into two divided souls. Once you were a few minutes older than me. When you return you will be three years younger than I am; if they cut us in two like our ginkgo trees, will they find that you have fewer rings than I do?

Year Nine
I have a baby now. Her name is Ella. She has brown eyes, black hair, she’s very pink and she has this thousand mile stare, as though she’s looking through us with x-ray vision, as though she can see the future and she’s not too sure it’s worth bothering with. The cats don’t like Ella. I can see why, she hits them and clutches their fur whenever they come too close. By the time you are home she will be walking, but tonight I carry her from room to room, moving through the dark flat in an irregular orbit, singing to her.

Year Ten
And now you are coming home.
And now you are almost here.
And now
