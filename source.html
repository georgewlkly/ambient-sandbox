<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year One</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dreamt about you again last night. We were in an unfamiliar house, it was barely dawn. You got out of bed and walked out the window, you walked across the lawn but you didn’t touch the wet grass, you were walking on air. I stood at the window watching as you walked higher and higher into the sky and finally the sun was too bright and I couldn’t see you any more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ginkgo tree looks like a big toothpick with a few little toothpicks stuck onto it. It stands there in the frozen garden looking lonely and patient. Or maybe that’s me. How is your tree? It’s funny to think that they are clones, they just look like two trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I feel stupid talking to myself like this, but I have to talk to someone and you are so far away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Two</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everything that happens to me, I want to tell you about it. But by the time you are home again, I’ll have forgotten all these small events that make up my days.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spring is here, there are daffodils in the garden. The ginkgo tree might be thinking about spring. I can’t tell. It’s strange to imagine you out there moving so fast through space so empty there are no seasons. Is it like a prison cell, your tiny space ship? Or has it become an extension of your own body?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I stand in the garden looking at the night sky, wondering where you are in it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Three</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m getting used to being alone. I have my own routines, different from our routines. I cancelled the newspaper and instead I read the horoscopes on the internet over breakfast. I got my hair cut differently, just for the heck of it. I have two kittens named Lily and Tilly. They look just alike, black and white spots. They both want to sit on my lap at once. They fight over patches of sunlight. Guess who they remind me of?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ginkgo tree is having a good summer, it has leafed out and it’s noticably taller now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Four<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I met someone. HIs name is Steven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had a dream that you were sleeping and your space ship was singing to you. It sang: <i>Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home. </i>I woke up and Steven was singing in the kitchen, he was making coffee and singing that old song so sweetly, in a voice too quiet to reach you, just barely loud enough to reach into my dream and make a lullaby for your dream self.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> </b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Five</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do you ever think about Einstein? The clueless bastard. He was right about the math but he never imagined that anyone would actually put his thought experiments into action; he didn’t forsee you and me, separated by time and space and science. He was heartbroken about the atomic bomb, but he never imagined or worried about the small heartbreak of twin girls losing years to an experiment because who would be stupid enough to agree to participate in such a thing? You and me, it turns out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Science is relentless, it always has to prove things, it can’t leave any magic or mystery or doubt unexamined. All I want is to keep a few secrets (except from you).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> </b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Six</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I worry that I’ve changed too much, that you won’t recognize me when you come home. Steven said, <i>There’s a part of you that I can’t reach, it belongs to your twin and I’ll never know you the way she does</i>. And of course he’s right. But as time passes there’s more and more of me that belongs only to him, and neither of you can be my other half, we are more like a Venn diagram, you both overlap with me and we each have secret individual parts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> </b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> </b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Seven</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am worried about the ginkgo tree. It doesn’t seem to be growing. It hasn’t died, it doesn’t look bad or anything, it just isn’t getting any taller.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes I think about moving to a bigger flat, this one is too small for me and Steven and all our books and the cats and all the stuff we have accumulated. But the tree is here and I would feel heartless if I abandoned it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> </b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Eight</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now I am in the extra years, I am moving ahead of you in time. We began together, a single cell that divided and went on dividing until it split into two divided souls. Once you were a few minutes older than me. When you return you will be three years younger than I am; if they cut us in two like our ginkgo trees, will they find that you have fewer rings than I do?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Nine</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a baby now. Her name is Ella. She has brown eyes, black hair, she’s very pink and she has this thousand mile stare, as though she’s looking through us with x-ray vision, as though she can see the future and she’s not too sure it’s worth bothering with. The cats don’t like Ella. I can see why, she hits them and clutches their fur whenever they come too close. By the time you are home she will be walking, but tonight I carry her from room to room, moving through the dark flat in an irregular orbit, singing to her.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> </b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Year Ten</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And now you are coming home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And now you are almost here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And now</span></p>
